This project is a Minion-themed mobile app developed for our Mobile Apps for Sensing and Learning class. 
The app includes a Minion Directory, where users can browse and view detailed information about their favorite Minions, 
a Minion Mini Quiz to test users' knowledge of the Minions, a Minion Scrapbook, which allows users to scroll through 
and enjoy pictures of the Minions in an interactive format, and a Banana Stocks page, with live stock data about Dole, Fresh Del Monte, and Calavo Growers.
